To view the tickets that have been assigned to an agents, go to Tickets → My Tickets

Here we can see the ticket assigned to the administrator agent/account Melisa.

Despite being the administrator, this account cannot view or access the other tickets by default as those tickets have been assigned to other departments – this account is a part of the System Administrators department and can only view tickets assigned to System Administrators.

Click on the ticket to access it.

Once you have entered the ticket interface, you have the option to reply to the ticket sender and change the ticket status.
